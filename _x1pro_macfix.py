X1 Pro MAC fix patch for 02_network.
Injects a case block that reads WAN/LAN MAC from Factory partition
(offset 0xe000), because the kernel DSA driver fails to read MAC via
nvmem (returns all-FFs).
This script is called from diy-part1.sh — kept separate to avoid shell
heredoc tab/backslash escaping that would corrupt the patch.
